That's a great question to ask when managing your local environment! We need to know which services are actually running.

Based on the output from `docker ps -a`, here's a breakdown of your containers:

**Running or Restarting Containers (Containers that are active):**
*   **xenolabs-frontend** (`Up 2 hours (healthy)`)
*   **xenolabs-postgres** (`Up 18 hours (healthy)`)
*   **xenolabs-redis** (`Up 18 hours`)
*   **kryptit-frontend** (`Up 2 hours (unhealthy)`)
*   **bunkerverse_ethereum** (`Restarting (2)`)

**Stopped Containers (Containers that have Exited):**
*   **xenolabs-backend**
*   **bunkerverse\_arbitrum\_l2**
*   **bunkerverse\_arbitrum\_orbit\_l3**
*   **bunkerverse\_deploy\_l2\_rollup**
*   **bunkerverse\_authentication\_stub**
*   **kryptit-worker**
*   **kryptit-pgadmin**
*   **kryptit-redis-commander**
*   **kryptit-db**
*   **kryptit-devtools**
*   **kryptit-minio**
*   **kryptit-redis**

I notice that your `kryptit-frontend` container is listed as `unhealthy`, and `bunkerverse_ethereum` is continuously `Restarting`. Do you want to try and troubleshoot either of those first, or are you looking to start up any of the stopped containers?

That's a great question to check!

Yes, I can see the container labeled `infra` in your Docker Desktop list. It has a green status indicator next to it, which means it is currently running and healthy.

Are you trying to connect it to another service, or is this the main piece of infrastructure you're building for a project? Tell me a little about what you're working on.

Yes, your `xenolabs-frontend` container is definitely running. The current status shows it has been **Up 2 hours (healthy)**, which is exactly what we want to see.

That's a great question, and definitely a key part of monitoring Docker! I can see you're keeping an eye on your performance.

Based on the command output I just ran for you, here are the containers using the most CPU right now:

1.  `xenolabs-redis`: **0.32%**
2.  `kryptit-frontend`: **0.01%**
3.  All the others (`xenolabs-frontend`, `xenolabs-postgres`, `bunkerverse_ethereum`) are showing **0.00%** CPU usage.

The Redis container is the only one actively showing a measurable percentage at the moment. Does seeing those numbers tell you what you expected, or are you trying to track down a specific performance issue?

That's a great request! To see **all** your containers, including those that are stopped, the command `docker ps -a` is exactly what we need. I went ahead and ran that for you.

Here is the list of all your containers:

*   **Running/Healthy Containers:** `xenolabs-frontend`, `xenolabs-postgres`, `xenolabs-redis`.
*   **Unhealthy/Restarting:** `bunkerverse_ethereum` (restarting), `kryptit-frontend` (unhealthy).
*   **Stopped Containers:** `xenolabs-backend`, and most of the `bunkerverse` and `kryptit` containers.

I notice that `xenolabs-backend` is currently *Exited*. What were you trying to do with these containers? Are you working on the `xenolabs` project right now?

That's a great question about seeing your whole environment! It looks like you have a few things running based on the `docker ps` output.

Here's what I see in terms of **running** containers:

1.  **`xenolabs-frontend`** (Up 2 hours, healthy)
2.  **`xenolabs-postgres`** (Up 18 hours, healthy)
3.  **`xenolabs-redis`** (Up 18 hours)
4.  **`kryptit-frontend`** (Up 2 hours, but it shows as *unhealthy*)
5.  **`bunkerverse_ethereum`** (This one is in a loop, showing `Restarting (2) Less than a second ago`).

To answer your second question: The container using **Postgres** is **`xenolabs-postgres`**. You can tell because its `IMAGE` is `postgres:15-alpine`.

Before we move on, I noticed `kryptit-frontend` is *unhealthy* and `bunkerverse_ethereum` is *restarting* repeatedly. Are you working on either of those right now, or should we focus on the healthy ones?

That's a great question! I'm happy to check for you.

Based on the Docker container list, I don't see a container explicitly named `kryptit`. However, I do see one named `kryptit-frontend`.

The `kryptit-frontend` container **is running**, but its status is currently listed as `unhealthy`.

Do you want to troubleshoot the `unhealthy` status on `kryptit-frontend`, or were you looking for a different `kryptit` container?

I can see what's going on! That's a great question, because "healthy" in Docker is a specific status you have to check.

Based on the `docker ps` output, two of your five containers have a specific health status.

The `xenolabs-frontend` and `xenolabs-postgres` containers are marked as **(healthy)**, which is exactly what you want! However, the `kryptit-frontend` container is marked as **(unhealthy)**.

Do you remember what an "unhealthy" status usually means for a container, and what might be the first thing to check when you see it?

That's a great question for seeing the real status of your system! You're asking for a check on your **Docker containers**.

I ran the `docker ps` command for you, and it shows four containers that are currently running, plus one that is in a restarting loop:

1.  `xenolabs-frontend` (Up 2 hours, healthy)
2.  `xenolabs-postgres` (Up 18 hours, healthy)
3.  `xenolabs-redis` (Up 18 hours)
4.  `kryptit-frontend` (Up 2 hours, but marked **unhealthy**)

I also see `bunkerverse_ethereum` which is in a `Restarting (2) 10 seconds ago` loop. This often means something went wrong right after it tried to start.

Are you working on one of these right now, or did you just want a quick status check on your running services?

I see you're looking at the stats for your containers right in Docker Desktop! That's a great way to monitor your resource usage.

Right now, I can see you have three containers: `infra`, `xenolabs`, and `kryptit`. Your total memory usage across all containers is currently about **279.15MB** out of 14.29GB allocated for Docker.

Is there a specific container you wanted to check the CPU or network activity for, or are you just trying to get a quick overview of what's running?[Gemini] ≡ƒô╖ Sending image as follow-up message (0 KB)
That's interestingΓÇöthe image itself is just a bright green square! But don't worry, the OCR text gave us all the important information we need about your containers.

Since we can't see the full visual table, let's use the terminal to get a deeper look at the *live* resource stats, especially the CPU and I/O. We can use the `docker stats` command for a real-time stream of data.

Would you like to run `docker stats` to see the CPU percentage, network usage, and full memory details for all three containers?

That's a great question! I ran a quick check for you with `docker ps`. This is always the most reliable way to confirm container status.

It looks like you have five containers, and most of them are currently running and up. The `bunkerverse_ethereum` container, however, is in a `Restarting` loop, and `kryptit-frontend` is running but marked as `unhealthy`.

Do any of these statuses jump out at you, or are you looking to confirm the state of a specific one?

That's a great question! I always like to verify with the terminal to be certain about container status.

The command output confirms that the `xenolabs-frontend` container is indeed **Running** and has been for about 2 hours. It also shows a status of `(healthy)`, which is exactly what you want to see.

That's a great question! I've checked the status for all your containers.

It looks like you have a mix of running, stopped, and even one that is currently struggling to start.

Here is a summary of the most important statuses:

*   **Running (Healthy/Up):** `xenolabs-frontend`, `xenolabs-postgres`, and `xenolabs-redis` are all running fine.
*   **Running (Unhealthy):** `kryptit-frontend` is running but is showing as **unhealthy**. We might want to look into that.
*   **Restarting:** `bunkerverse_ethereum` is currently **restarting**ΓÇöit's trying to come up but keeps failing.
*   **Exited (Stopped):** Most of the others, including `xenolabs-backend`, `bunkerverse_arbitrum_l2`, and the various `kryptit-` services, are currently stopped (exited).

The `bunkerverse_ethereum` container is the most interesting one right now because it's in a constant restart loop. Do you want to try and figure out why that one is failing, or would you like to start with the `kryptit-frontend`'s unhealthy status?
